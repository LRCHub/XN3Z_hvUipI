Cheers then, here's to old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And it's not worth another try
Familiar place, familiar face
But feeling's not the same
Try to relive what we once did
It's just a silly game

Cheers then, here's to old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And it's not worth another try
One of the crowd
It felt so safe
I never felt alone
Together everyday and night
When you and me were young

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh...

Cheers then, here's to old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And it's not worth another try
Time that lapsed, a bond collapsed
We never planned for that
You felt betrayed, I let you down
You're better on your own

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh...

Cheers then, it had to end
Cheers then, another try
Cheers then, here's to old friends
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye

Cheers then, another try
Cheers then, it had to end
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye
Cheers then, here's to old friends
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye
Cheers then
