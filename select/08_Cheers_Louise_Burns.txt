Sometimes I think about it
Sometimes I don't think at all
Don't look back
Someone told me
You'll feel sad most of all

Like the summer when I stopped my eating so I'd gain
Approval: you told me I looked good, I listened
I know it sounds sick but sometimes I still miss it
I'd go back if only to say

Cheers to the times
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away
Cheers to the times
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away
We were legends just for one day
So cheers to the times
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away

Bury it in a memory
Lock it up behind a wall

With those nights in the valley
Before we turned twenty
A palace, a promise, a hope adolescent
I know it sounds but sometimes I still miss it I'd go back if only to say

Cheers to the times
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away
Cheers to the times
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away
We were legends just for one day
So cheers to the times
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away
That we let slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away
