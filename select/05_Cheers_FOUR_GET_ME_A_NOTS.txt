Holding your hands
We're running again
To the future we see
What is ahead
This is a path
It's leading forever
Taking a step
You can do it

We used to be so stubborn
Had some fights with our opinions
But what is more important
You were there for me

Holding your hands
We're running again
To the future we see
What is ahead
This is a path
It's leading forever
Taking a step
You can do it

I haven't tell you
My gratitude for you

My gratitude for you

Thank you so much walking with me
Thank you so much laughing with me
Thank you so much crying with me
Thank you so much living with me

Holding your hands
We're running again
To the future we see
What is ahead
This is a path
It's leading forever
Taking a step
You can do it

Don't just pretend
On living a life of somebody
Let's all move on
Creating a new road we built from a scratch
And make a whole new future
